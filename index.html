            <p class="info">
                Gustav (or "Goose" for short) is our 4-year old Dalmatian. We have had him for 2-years where he has lived with Josh and another family pet. He is neutered, housebroken, kennel trained, and is accustomed to living indoors. He is a very gentle, low-energy,
                "chill" dog who enjoys going on long walks and hikes just as much as lying at our feet while listening to music.

            <h1 class="heading">HEALTH &amp; GROOMING</h1>
            <p class="info">
                As mentioned above, Gustav is neutered and up-to-date on all vaccines. His veterinary doctor is Dr. Sudha Kakarla at Sylvan Veterinary Hospital in Modesto, CA. He goes in for regular check-ups twice a year. We feed Gustav twice a day, once in the morning
                around 8:30-9am, and once in the evening around 6pm and then he is taken on a walk between one and three miles long, and is bathed once a month. If neither of us are home, usually he will go into his kennel. If we will be gone for a considerable
                amount of time, we will take him to our family&rsquo;s house for the duration of our absence.

            <h1 class="heading">TRAINING</h1>
            <p class="info">
                Gustav is trained to let us know when he needs to go to the bathroom by standing next to the door and laying down, we always carry pick-up bags when we take him outside. He also kennel trained for when we are out of the house and he will be alone for
                a period of time.
